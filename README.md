# Bag of holding

This repository contains some
[lightyear](https://github.com/cBournhonesque/lightyear)-related helper crates.

***NOTE:** Unlike some of the other repositories I've made public, I don't intend to
actively support these as open source crates. I've not event published them to
crates.io! I personally use them and will update them as needed for my own use
cases, but I don't have the bandwith to actively provide support.*

*I include this here so you may consider vendoring this code rather than
directly depending on it if you're interested in using it.*
